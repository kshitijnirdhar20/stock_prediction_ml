# stock_prediction_ml
 This project predicts stock prices using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Linear Regression based on historical stock data. The model takes date values as input and learns to forecast future prices using different regression techniques.








ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ” SVR Models (RBF, Linear, Polynomial) for price prediction
âœ” Linear Regression as a baseline model
âœ” MinMax Scaling for improved performance
âœ” Data Visualization for model comparison









ðŸš€ Future Enhancements:
Add train/test split & model evaluation (RMSE, RÂ²)
Incorporate deep learning (LSTM, GRU) for better accuracy
Integrate real-time stock data API for live predictions
ðŸ“Œ How to Use: Clone the repo, download the historical data of the stock and run predict_prices() to get future stock predictions!
